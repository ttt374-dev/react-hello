Hey guys, what's up? Matt here and today I just wanted to make a quick video to answer

00:03.360 --> 00:06.960
a question that I've been getting a lot recently, which is what do you think is the most ideal

00:06.960 --> 00:11.360
ratio between passive immersion and active immersion? Now the short answer is I don't really

00:11.360 --> 00:15.360
think the ratio matters much at all. The bottom line is that the more you do of each type of

00:15.360 --> 00:18.960
immersion, the more quickly that you're going to improve. So let's take a step back real quick

00:18.960 --> 00:23.280
and define our terms. So what do I really mean when I say active immersion versus passive immersion?

00:23.280 --> 00:26.560
Well, I actually have a whole video on this topic that I made a couple years ago, so I'll put a

00:26.560 --> 00:30.400
link to that in the description, but the short summary is that active immersion is when you're

00:30.400 --> 00:34.320
sitting down and giving your full undivided attention to consuming something in your target

00:34.320 --> 00:38.000
language, whether that's sitting down and reading a book or sitting down and watching a TV show

00:38.000 --> 00:42.880
and just pausing and looking things up and making a real effort to try to understand what's happening.

00:42.880 --> 00:46.000
Now you don't actually have to be sitting down while you do active immersion, but for whatever

00:46.000 --> 00:50.560
reason that's the image of active immersion that I have in my head. On the other hand, we have passive

00:50.560 --> 00:54.720
immersion, which is where you're listening to something in your target language while you do

00:54.720 --> 01:01.040
another activity, whether that's cook or clean or commute or exercise. Now the amount of attention

01:01.040 --> 01:05.040
that you're paying while doing passive immersion tends to fluctuate a lot moment to moment,

01:05.040 --> 01:09.360
but because in general, you're going to be doing passive immersion while engaging in a mindless

01:09.360 --> 01:14.160
activity like cooking or cleaning, it is possible to pay a pretty decent amount of attention to your

01:14.160 --> 01:18.480
target language while doing passive immersion. Now there's also a third type of immersion called

01:18.480 --> 01:21.920
background immersion, which is where you pretty much just leave target language audio playing in

01:22.000 --> 01:26.880
the background and then ignore it and do totally other activities, but that's not really too relevant

01:26.880 --> 01:32.240
to this particular video. Now in general, active immersion is more beneficial per minute than passive

01:32.240 --> 01:36.240
immersion is simply because you're paying more attention, you're looking things up and you're just

01:36.240 --> 01:41.360
doing more work. So if you ever have an option between doing 10 more minutes of active immersion

01:41.360 --> 01:45.520
or 10 additional minutes of passive immersion, well from a raw efficiency point of view, it's going to

01:45.520 --> 01:50.000
be better to pick the active immersion because you're going to improve more per minute while doing

01:50.000 --> 01:55.040
active rather than passive, but the thing is in general, we do passive immersion during times

01:55.040 --> 02:00.080
inner day where we wouldn't be able to do active immersion, like I said earlier, like when you're cooking,

02:00.080 --> 02:04.880
cleaning, exercising, these are all situations where it's not possible to do active immersion because

02:04.880 --> 02:09.200
by definition, active immersion is when you're not multitasking, it's when you're giving your full

02:09.200 --> 02:14.240
undivided attention just to the immersion. And so when we're talking about times inner day where

02:14.240 --> 02:19.040
we're commuting, cooking, cleaning, these are things that we have to do, we can't just not clean

02:19.120 --> 02:23.680
anymore or not commute anymore, but those are also times where we are not able to do active

02:23.680 --> 02:28.560
immersion. So we're left with this choice of doing passive immersion or nothing. And although active

02:28.560 --> 02:32.880
immersion is more beneficial per minute than passive immersion, passive immersion is much much,

02:32.880 --> 02:37.440
much more beneficial per minute than no immersion at all. So it's always better to just do passive

02:37.440 --> 02:41.440
immersion when you can and do active immersion when you can. And this is why ratios aren't really

02:41.440 --> 02:45.680
applicable. So here's another framework that you can use to think about it. Let's say that we have

02:45.680 --> 02:50.640
this concept of immersion points and it takes a certain number of immersion points to get fluent

02:50.640 --> 02:54.800
in a foreign language. Now let's say that you get four immersion points per minute when doing

02:54.800 --> 03:00.000
active immersion and you get one immersion point per minute when doing passive immersion. Well,

03:00.000 --> 03:03.520
of course, if you have an option, you want to be doing active immersion because you're going to get

03:03.520 --> 03:07.760
more points per minute, which is going to move you closer to fluency, but during situations where

03:07.760 --> 03:11.840
active immersion isn't possible, well, it's still better to do passive immersion than nothing because

03:11.920 --> 03:16.320
at least you're getting one point per minute and every four minutes you basically have accumulated

03:16.320 --> 03:22.480
the equivalent of one minute worth of active immersion. Now this ratio of four to one when it comes

03:22.480 --> 03:27.280
to the value of passive versus active is a little iffy. It's hard to say exactly what the difference

03:27.280 --> 03:31.040
is because like I said before, the amount of attention that you're really paying while doing passive

03:31.040 --> 03:36.480
immersion tends to change quite a bit. And also the more active immersion that you do in general,

03:36.480 --> 03:40.640
the more you're going to benefit from passive immersion. But I think as a general framework,

03:40.640 --> 03:45.200
thinking of three to four minutes of passive immersion, being equivalent to around one minute

03:45.200 --> 03:50.000
of active immersion is probably an okay rule of thumb. So in conclusion, the ratio between your

03:50.000 --> 03:53.920
active immersion and your passive immersion doesn't actually matter. Just do active immersion when

03:53.920 --> 03:58.560
you can and when you can't do passive immersion. And in general, the more you do of each, the more

03:58.560 --> 04:02.880
quickly that you'll move towards fluency. I hope this little video was useful to you guys. If it was,
