immersion, the more quickly that you're going to improve. So let's take a step back real quick

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.280
and define our terms. So what do I really mean when I say active immersion versus passive immersion?

link to that in the description, but the short summary is that active immersion is when you're
